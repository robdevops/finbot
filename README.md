Trade notifications are peformed by polling the Sharesight trades API from a cron job, and notifying your configured chat networks of any new trades. Thus, it works best if your trades are auto-imported into Sharesight through its broker integrations, and if your environment has persistent storage so that the bot can keep track of known trade IDs between runs.

The other various reports can also run from cron (e.g. daily or weekly), or on demand through the interactive bot. They query the Yahoo Finance API for stock data based on current holdings across your Sharesight portfolios, your friends' Sharesight portfolios, plus a custom watch list. Depending on how they're triggered, they will either report to all configured chat networks, or reply to the chat which triggered them.

The interactive bot component requires you to host a web service on a domain with a trusted certificate. It subscribes to push updates from native Slack apps / Telegram bots, and reacts to certain regex seen in chat. It provides:
* Stock lookup (financials and company profile)
* Group maintainable watch list, picked up by the various reports
* Listing of portfolios, portfolio performance, and holdings 
* Running the other stock reports on demand

## Reports

### Stock lookup
![Screenshot showing stock info on Slack](img/stockinfo.png?raw=true "Screenshot showing stock info on Slack")

The stock lookup returns various stats relevant to a stock's valuation, growth and risk factors.

#### Emoji legend
* The colored circle next to the symbol at the top indicates the current market state:
    * üî¥ market closed
    * üü† pre/post-market
    * üü¢ normal trading
* The warning symbol ‚ö†Ô∏è indicates possible risk factors. This is not intended to replace due diligence, but to non-exhaustively highlight where additional diligence is due. Some risk factors include:
    * Negative earnings ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * Earnings in decline ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * Negative cashflow ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * High short interest ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * High forward P/E ratio ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * Net insider selling ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * High debt-to-equity ratio ‚ö†Ô∏è
* The arrow grid indicates the directional change in the company earnings and revenue for each reporting period. A red arrow indicates the absolute earnings was negative:
    * üîº earnings/revenue increased from the previous period
    * üîΩ earnings/revenue decreased from the previous period
    * üî∫ earnings increased from the previous period but remained negative
    * üîª earnings decreased from the previous period and was negative
    * ‚ñ™Ô∏è  earnings/revenue matched the previous period
    * ‚ùå data is missing for this period
* Using the example screenshot above, Crowdstrike reported:
    * üîºüîºüîº revenue increased in all of the past three quarters
    * üî∫üîªüîª In the past three quarters, earnings initially increased, then decreased for two quarters, and was negative in every quarter
    * üîºüîºüîº revenue increased in all of the past three years
    * üîªüî∫üîª In the past three years, earnings decreased, increased, then decreased, and was negative for all three years

This report can only be run through the interactive bot. Example usage:
```
.AAPL
```
```
@botname AAPL
```

### Company Profile
![Screenshot showing stock profile on Slack](img/bio.png?raw=true "Screenshot showing stock profile on Slack")

This report can only be run through the interactive bot. Example usage:
```
.profile AAPL
```
```
@botname profile AAPL
```

### Trades
![trade update in Slack](img/trades.png?raw=true "Trade update in Slack")

`trades.py` sends recent Sharesight trades to your configured chat services.
By default, this report searches Sharesight for trades from the current day only. You can override this with `past_days` in the .env file, or by providing a number as argument when triggered through the chat bot.

Without persistent storage, it is recommended to leave `past_days = 0` to avoid duplicate trade notifications. In this case, the cron that triggers the report must do so exactly once per day, after market close.

With persistent storage, it is recommended to set `past_days = 30`. This is useful if Sharesight imports trades with past dates for any reason. Note that the initial run will notify on all historical trades for the `past_days` period. It is recommended to set the cron frequency to 20 minutes.

```
past_days = 30
```

Interactive trigger:
```
.trades [days]
```
```
@botname trades [days]
```

You can also specify a portfolio name to get today's trades for just that portfolio:
```
.trades [portfolio]
```
```
@botname trades [portfolio]
```

### Price alerts
![price alert in Slack](img/price.png?raw=true "Price alert in Slack")

`prices.py` sends premarket, midsession, and interday price movements if holdings moved over a percentage threshold. This data is sourced from Yahoo! Finance and Sharesight. The default threshold is 10% but you can change it by setting `price_percent` in the .env file, or by providing a number as argument when triggered through the chat bot. Decimal fractions are accepted.

Config example:
```
price_percent = 9.4
```

Cron trigger:
```
./price.py [premarket|midsession|interday|days (int)]
```
When scheduled (Cron), the mode must be passed as an execution argument.
* If `premarket` is passed, it only reports on pre/post market price movements.
* If `midsession` is passed, it only reports for markets currently in session. This is intended to run from Cron to provide mid-session alerts for big price movements of your holdings. For example, it could be run twice per day 12 hours apart, to capture markets in different timezones. It can also be run through the interactive bot  as shown below.
* If `interday` is passed, it reports current price against the previous market close.
* If an integer [i] is passed, it reports current price against [i] days ago.

Interactive trigger (pre-market):
Interactively, you can also optionally specify the number of days to compare against.
```
.premarket [percent]
```
```
@botname premarket [percent]
```

Interactive trigger (mid-session):
```
.midsession [percent]
```
```
@botname midsession [percent]
```

Interactive trigger (interday).
```
.price [percent]
```
```
@botname [percent]
```

For interday, can also specify the number of days:
```
.price 10% [5d]
```

Or a specific stock:
```
.price AAPL [90d]
```

### Portfolio performance
![Screenshot of Portfolio performance notification on Slack](img/performance.png?raw=true "Screenshot performance notification on Slack")

`performance.py` reports on Sharesight portfolio performance over a given period. The default is set by `past_days` in the .env file, which can be overridden at runtime by specifying an integer as the argument.

Config example:
```
past_days = 28
```

Cron trigger:
```
./performance.py 7
```

Interactive trigger:
```
.performance 7
```
```
@botname performance 7
```

Interactively, you can instead specify a portfolio:
```
.performance [portfolio]
```
```
@botname performance [portfolio]
```

### Events calendar
![earnings message in Slack](img/earnings.png?raw=true "Earnings message in Slack")

`cal.py` sends upcoming earnings and ex-dividend date alerts. The data is sourced from Yahoo! Finance. It reports on events up to `future_days` into the future. This is set in the .env file for triggering the report from Cron, or can be specified as an argument when triggered through the chat bot.

**Finance Explainer:** When a company releases its quarterly earnings report, the stock price may undergo a signficant positive or negative movement, depending on whether the company beat or missed market expectations. You may wish to hold off buying more of this stock until after its earnings report, unless you think the stock will beat market expectations.

**Finance Explainer:** When a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price [typically drops](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/ex_dividend.asp) by the amount of the dividend paid. If you buy right before the ex-dividend date, you can expect an unrealised capital loss, plus a tax obligation for the dividend. Thus, you may wish to wait for the ex-dividend date before buying more of this stock.
```
future_days = 7
```

Cron execution:
```
./cal.py [earnings|ex-dividend]
```

Interactive trigger (earnings):
```
.earnings [days]
```
```
@botname earnings [days]
```

Interactive trigger (ex-dividend):
```
.dividend [days]
```
```
@botname dividend [days]
```

### Highly shorted stock warnings
![short warnings in Slack](img/shorts.png?raw=true "Short warnings in Slack")

`shorts.py` sends short interest warnings. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance and Shortman (AU). `shorts_percent` defines the alert threshold for the percentage of a stock's float shorted. This can be specified in the .env file for running the report from Cron, or as an argument when triggered through the chat bot.

**Finance Explainer:** A high short ratio indicates a stock is exposed to high risks, such as potential banktrupcy. It may also incentivise negative news articles which harm the stock price. If the market is wrong, however, risk tolerant investors may receive windfall gains. This report is intended to alert you to an above-average risk, and prompt you to investigate this stock more closely.
```
shorts_percent = 15
```

Interactive trigger:
```
.shorts [percent]
```
```
@botname shorts [percent]
```

### Watchlist
![Shared watchlist in Slack](img/watchlist.png?raw=true "Shared watchlist in Slack")

Tracks additional securities which are not in your Sharesight holdings.

It is stored in `var/cache/finbot_watchlist.json` by default. It is a JSON array literal containing Yahoo symbols. Example:
```
["2454.TW", "3217.TWO", "ASO.AX", "STEM"]
```

When run interactively, the watchlist is dynamic and can be edited by members of a chat group. In this case, there is no need to create/edit the file manually.

Interactive trigger:
```
.watchlist
```
```
.watchlist [add|del] AAPL
```
```
@botname watchlist
```
```
@botname watchlist [add|del] AAPL
```

## Installation (Linux)
```
sudo $(which apt dnf yum) install git python3-pip
```
```
git clone https://github.com/robdevops/finbot.git ~/finbot
```
```
cd ~/finbot
```
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
Configuration is set by the .env file in the main directory. Example:
```
vi ~/finbot/.env
```

### Sharesight
* Email Sharesight support to get an API key and add the [access details](https://portfolio.sharesight.com/oauth_consumers) to the .env file. Example:
```
sharesight_code = '01d692d4de7 samplefc64bc2e2f01d692d4de72986ea808f6e99813f'
sharesight_client_id = '01d692d4de7 samplefc64bc2e2f01d692d4de72986ea808f6e99813f'
sharesight_client_secret = '01d692d4de7 samplefc64bc2e2f01d692d4de72986ea808f6e99813f'
```

### Discord
Discord support is currently only for trade notifications and scheduled reports.
The Discord webhook can be provisioned in Discord under _Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks_.
Example:
```
discord_webhook = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1009998000000000000/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbbb'
```

### Slack
A Slack webhook can be provisioned by creating a new app from scratch at https://api.slack.com/apps/ then navigating to _Incoming Webhooks_. Once the link is generated, add it to the .env file. Example:
```
slack_webhook = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYYY/AAAAAAAAmockupAAAAAAAAAAAA'
```
The webhook is only used for the trade notifications and scheduled reports. The interactive bot requires further configuration of this Slack app (see below).

### Telegram
* Set up the bot by messaging [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
* Add your bot to a group or channel.
* For security, run `/setjoingroups` and set to `Disabled`
* Optionally, make the bot a group admin (for interactive features).
* In the .env file, set `telegramBotToken` to the token BotFather gave you.
* In the .env file, set `telegramChatID` to the chat group or channel id.
   * For channels and supergroups, `telegramChatID` should be negative and 13 characters. Prepend `-100` if necessary.
   * Be aware a group id can change if you edit group settings and it becomes a "supergroup". Currently, the bot does not automatically handle this.
* Example .env entry:
```
telegramBotToken = '0000000000:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
telegramChatID = -1001000000000
```

### Portfolios
Portfolios are auto-discovered, including other people's portfolios which are shared to you. To exclude specific portfolios, add their IDs to `exclude_portfolios` in the .env file:
```
exclude_portfolios = "100003 100004"
```

Alternatively, you can include only specific portfolios:
```
include_portfolios = "100001 100002"
```

### Caching
Many objects are cached for just under one day by default. Cache is controlled by the settings below. Trades IDs are stored on disk, but trade queries generally don't result in a cache hit for functional reasons.
```
cache = True
cache_seconds = 82800
```

### Hyperlinks
These .env file options relate to hyperlinks:

* `hyperlink`, if set to `False`, disables all hyperlinks. Note: it can not disable syntax highlighting and false positives by chat clients that try to detect domains. Setting it to `False` can be useful for chat networks like Discord that can't easily disable link previews. Defaults to `True`.
```
hyperlink = True
```

* `hyperlinkFooter` appends hyperlinks to the company website and to a Google search for the ticker on simplywall.st  for the symbol lookup report. Possible values are `True` or `False`. Defaults to `False`.

```
hyperlinkFooter = True
```

* `hyperlinkProvider` configures where to send ticker hyperlinks. Available values are `google` and `yahoo`. If set to `google`, it is only used where practical, as Google does not publish earnings date, ex-dividend date, premarket price, or short interest figures. Defaults to `yahoo`.
```
hyperlinkProvider = google
```
```
hyperlinkProvider = yahoo
```

## Scheduling example
Recommended for a machine set to UTC:
```
# Every 20 minutes on weekdays
*/20 * * * Mon-Fri ~/finbot/trades.py &> /dev/null

# Mid-session
00 01 * * Mon-Fri ~/finbot/price.py midsession &> /dev/null # AU
15 17 * * Mon-Fri ~/finbot/price.py midsession &> /dev/null # US

# Daily
30  21 * * * ~/finbot/reminder.py > /dev/null

# Daily on weekdays
29  21 * * Mon-Fri ~/finbot/price.py interday &> /dev/null
10  11 * * Mon-Fri ~/finbot/price.py premarket &> /dev/null

# Weekly
28  21 * * Sat { cd ~/finbot/; ./cal.py earnings; ./cal.py ex-dividend; ./price.py 7; ./performance.py 7 ;} &> /dev/null

# Monthly
27  21 1 * * { cd ~/finbot/; ./shorts.py; ./price.py 28; ./performance.py 28 ;} &> /dev/null
```
The above can be installed with:
```
(crontab -l ; cat ~/finbot/crontab.txt)| crontab -
```

## Interactive bot setup
The backend `bot.py` needs a frontend https server on a valid domain name with a valid x509 certifcate.
It defaults to listening on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which can be changed with `ip` and `port` in the .env file.

Example frontend https server config (nginx):
```
server {
	listen 8443 ssl;
	deny all;

	server_name         www.example.com;
	ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem;
	ssl_protocols       TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
	ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

	location /slack {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/slack;
                include /etc/nginx/aws_subnets;
                deny all;
	}
	location /telegram {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/telegram;
		include /etc/nginx/telegram_subnets;
		deny all;
	}
}
```
Note: The utils folder contains scripts to generate `/etc/nginx/aws_subnets` and `/etc/nginx/telegram_subnets`. They can be run once, or placed in `/etc/cron.daily/`.

### Integrating the interactive bot with chat networks

#### Telegram
* Message BotFather to create a bot user.
  * Set .env file `telegramBotToken` to the token given by BotFather.
  * Add your Telegram bot user to a group
    * Give the bot group admin access so it can read the group chat.
    * For security, message BotFather and disable `/setjoingroups`.
* Set .env `telegramOutgoingWebhook` to your web server (e.g. https://www.example.com:8443/telegram).
* Set `telegramOutgoingToken` to a password of your choosing. Telegram will use this to authenticate with finbot.
With these options set, your bot will auto-subscribe your URL to events the bot sees, when you run `bot.py`.

#### Slack
Visit https://api.slack.com/apps/ to create a new Slack app from scratch (if you already created one for a finbot webhook, you can reuse that app).
* From _Basic Information > Verification Token_, copy _Verification token_ into the .env file variable `slackOutgoingToken`. This allows Slack to authenticate with finbot.
* In the .env file, put your web server URL (e.g. https://www.example.com:8443/slack) into `slackOutgoingWebhook`
* Save the .env file and (re)start `bot.py`
* Under _Event Subscriptions_:
  * Go to _Enable Events > On > Request URL_ and enter your web server URL (e.g. https://www.example.com:8443/slack). At this time, if the bot is reachable, it will auto respond to Slack's verification request.
  * Go down to _Subscribe to bot events_ and add event `app_mention` for the bot to see _@botname_ mentions.
    * Alternatively, you can subscribe to `message.channels` if you want your bot to see everything and respond to `.` commands. To avoid duplicate responses, don't subscribe to `app_mention` and `message.channels` at the same time.
    * If you want to DM the bot:
      * Subscribe to `message.im`
      * Check the box _App Home > Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab_
  * Save Changes
* Under _OAuth & Permissions_: 
  * Scroll down to _Scopes > Bot Token Scopes_, and add `chat:write`
  * Scroll up to _OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace_:
    * If _Bot User OAuth Token_ is not visible, hit _Install to Workspace > Allow_ 
    * Copy _Bot User OAuth Token_ into .env file `slackBotToken`. This allows finbot to authenticate with Slack so it can send replies.
    * Restart `bot.py`

### Daemonize (systemd)
`finbot.service` can take care of keeping `bot.py` running in the background and starting it on boot. Copy `finbot.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`, edit it to set the `User` and `ExecStart`, then enable and start it:

```
sudo cp -v finbot.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
```
sudo sed -i 's/CHANGEME/YOUR LINUX USERNAME/' /etc/systemd/system/finbot.service
```
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
```
sudo systemctl enable finbot --now
```
You can now monitor the bot's stderr with :
```
journalctl -fu finbot
```

## Limitations
* Discord shows garbage link previews from Sharesight. Set `hyperlink = False`, or disable this for each Discord client under _Settings > Text & Images > Embeds and link previews_ (must be repeated for each participating Discord client).

## Suggestions
* Is my code is doing something the hard way?
* Something important is missing from this README?
